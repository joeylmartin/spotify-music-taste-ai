# Supervised learning for predicting Music Taste

This is an experiment based on using Supervised learning to calculate my music preferences. Over the past few years, I've listened to music with the following approach:

- Listen to a full album
- The favorites from the album get added to my 'Rock'(e.g.) playlist
- The favorites from the 'Rock' playlist get added to the 'Main' playlist

The approach to calculate the predicted quality relies on Spotify's 'feature' data, which has a few calculated attributes for each song.


This project has not been fully tested, as I have yet to get full Spotify API access. 429s occur after a couple minutes of running.
